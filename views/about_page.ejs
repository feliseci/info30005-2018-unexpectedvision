    <h2>OUR MISSION</h2>
    <p>To break down the echo chambers of today's political discussions, and to increase access to political
        information and activism opportunities.</p>

    <h2>ABOUT US </h2>
    <p>MultiView is a social platform for sharing knowledge, perspectives, and insight that seeks to address the
        question of <em>'how might we address global urgent challenges at the intersection of peace, prosperity and planet
            in radically new ways?'</em>.</p>
    </div>

    <div class = "item4">
    <p>The popularisation of social media platforms has brought with it the siloing of ideas and opinions into echo
        chambers due to the use of behaviour-centric algorithms to populate a user's feed with 'individual-specific' news
        and content. This is of particular concern to us as it tends to reinforce arguments and opinions from one
        perspective, rather than offering variety and/or challenging arguments and evidence. In the current Australian
        political climate, it is easy to be either apathetic to political issues by disengaging from the political
        discussions, or to witness the development of polarised groups. We want to empower the individual to get involved in
        the community through knowledge and positive action!</p>

    <h2>HOW TO APPROACH OUR WEBSITE</h2>
    <p> We aim to increase access to information about political issues, and serve as an starting point for further research
        for the everyday citizen! A key consideration for our website was how best to present information in a way that
        takes into account that on any given day different people want a different levels of detail about an issue.</p>
    </div>
    <div class = "item6">
    <h2><b>Our solution:</b> have thoughtful, well-researched individuals, editors, curate repositories of resources of
        different levels/styles <em>(i.e. high level, opinion pieces, reports)</em> referring to specific topics. In addition,
        users can contribute their own found online articles in the contributions section, which can offer another
        perspective on the issue, and engage with the contents of the editor's article. Any user can become an editor by
        applying through our website and citing relevant experience for the role - <em>see editor code of conduct.</em></h2>
